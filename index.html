    <p>We are living in an unprecedented time, characterized by the rapid progress of AI technology that holds the capacity to revolutionize our lives and occupations like never before, particularly when it comes to the world of art. </p>
    <p>We at Fiverr are eager to embrace the opportunities unfolding before us and to explore what happens when top tech meets top talent. That’s why we’re calling all artists to use the latest generative tools in a unique competition that simulates real-life business needs</p>
    <b>How It Works</b>
    <p>Starting today, all artists will be able to take their shot at the prizes by creating stunning AI-generated artwork. To enter, participants must choose between 3 briefs from hypothetical businesses in need of AI-generated artwork, fill out all required fields in the submission form, and submit their work in accordance with the submission guidelines posted on https://contests.fiverr.com/ai-art-2023. Submissions must be received no later than 11:59 pm EST on August 27th, 2023 to be considered. </p>
    <p>An all-star judges panel, including Nadav Barkan, Evyatar Edri, and Tal Zagreba, will determine the winners, based on submissions that demonstrate understanding of their chosen briefs, as well as creativity, originality, aesthetic appeal, and a mastery of AI. One winner and runner-up will be crowned for each of the 3 briefs. </p>
    <b>The Prizes</b>
    <p>Here’s where it gets really good… Three (3) grand prize winners will receive a $1,500 USD digital gift card and three (3) runner-up winners will receive a $500 USD digital gift card.
